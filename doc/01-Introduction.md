The Icinga PowerShell Kickstart is a simple PowerShell script allowing users to easily install and deploy the [Icinga PowerShell Framework](https://icinga.com/docs/windows/latest) on Windows machines by using the Icinga for Windows repository manager.

Once the Framework is installed the entire installation of Icinga Agents including many different components is possible.

The Kickstart script will lookup the source of the components being installed, depending on the provided argument configuration.

Please have a look on the [Installation Guide of the Framework](https://icinga.com/docs/windows/latest/doc/02-Installation/) on how to proceed.
